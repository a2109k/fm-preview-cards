## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-First workflow

### What I learned

Used CSS Flexbox for the page layout with developing UI for desktop first approach. All the fonts used in this project are listed in the fonts.scss file while all the CSS colors and font sizes used are listed in variables.scss file.

While development, the styles written in scss were compiled and converted into css using sass compiler. The compiled css stylesheet path is referenced in index.html.

### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - These Flexbox examples are all that I have used to develop this page.
